# Embers and Ash

## Overview
The world has come to an end. You are a survivor of the Armageddon and now live
amongst brimstone and embers, inhabiting a shell of the world that once was. 
Scavenging the charred surroundings for resources day
by day, you are completely alone, a drifting
mote amid a sea of ash. But Armageddon did not settle for simply destroying the world.
It created life of its own. Life wrought of fire, infernal creatures that appear to
hunt when darkness falls. Hide, or never be seen, for they are no friends of yours.
Trudge as far as your legs can take you, and perhaps you will find respite, safe haven
somewhere among the cinders.

## Proposal

1. Concept
Survive by scavenging your surroundings for food and resources. When night falls, fiery
monsters prowl the world. You cannot fight, and must hide when they pass by.

2. Genres
Adventure, Survival, Exploration, Avoidance

---

3. Platform:
Desktop, mobile friendly

---

4. Story:
A post-apocalyptic, scorched world. Somber and muted during the day, deadly and
terrifying at night. Always tense. Move about the destroyed world to find 
resources, used for food and interaction with the environment. When night falls, the
scavenging does not end. Instead, it becomes far more dangerous with the
appearance of walking flames. Alongside searching for resources, and hiding from
these creatures, search for a safe haven. Somewhere where there may be other people.

5. Aesthetic:
Art - Pixelated, but not cartoonish carries the theme and mood of the
       game in the art. Decrepit and ashen.
       
Sound - Simple. Footsteps, interaction sounds, a death sound, trailing
         fire for the monsters, and possible ambient sounds.
         Synthesized/8 or 16 bit.
         
Music - Music will carry the theme and mood as well, put together with
         guitars and possible synthesizer effects. Two iterations: day and
         night.

6. Gameplay:
Mechanics -
The player must search for resources by moving around the game world and interacting
with piles of objects, chests, visually disfigured parts of the gound, and ruins
of buildings. When examined, "Food" or "Other" resources can be found, or the
player may find nothing at all. Food can be consumed to increase the player's Survival
Time, which is similar to health in that when it reaches 0, the player dies. Other
resources are used to open chests and doors at the expense of the resource.
Enemies spawn when night falls, emittings a faint glow. The player must find something
to hide within to avoid these. They will seek the player and result in death if they
come in contact.
Somewhere in the map is a Safe Haven. If the player reaches this, they essentially
win by finding a gome for the character.

Controls -
WASD to move
SPACE to search objects
Q to interact (subh as opening a locked chest or door)
F to consume food
E to hide within something
V to drop an Other resource

Extra -
The player needs to learn how and when to hide form the enemies, and management of
resources, as there will be a limit to how many overall resources can be carries. This 
limit is shared between the two type of resources.
